Realtor Management Application
Realtors are looking for sales and rental management software to help them manage their properties very effectively, along with buyer and property information. As a Salesforce implementation partner company, you were asked to develop the solution using the Salesforce Platform. Here is all the information about the project.

Scope of Work
A custom Salesforce application for a company to oversee their Realtor management, Buyer & Realtor processes. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive solution for managing their systems. The application will include several features:


This app will include a private admin portal, and an available site for public usability.


The company can create different Properties and Buyers, and make them visible on the portal with information including the start date, end date, etc.


A Buyer needs to provide some mandatory information such as first name, last name, phone number and email address before creating the booking for the Property.


Salesforce must be integrated with an address gateway to process and confirm the address of the location (Smarty Street Api).


A manager will also receive an email for deleted Properties daily.
We will write several automation, validation, and duplicate rules in the system for automatically checking the Buyers of the Property.


We will create an email feature from the newly created Property Buyer to send information about the new Property details such as Property start date, location, etc. 


We will create a web service for other apps and share the Property details with any necessary app, so that you can publish your Property on any platform.


On the portal, the admin user can see lots of LWC components and the user can complete tasks easily on the LWC components.


Lead Management: The company can capture leads for prospective customers who fill out the web-to-lead form on their showroom or website. They can track the source of the lead and also store lead contact information and relevant details such as the Property preferences, etc.

Opportunity Management: Once a lead expresses interest in booking an Property, the company can create an opportunity in Salesforce. This would include details such as the Property type, start-end dates, features, and expected-to-publish date. Sales representatives can update the opportunity as they progress through the sales cycle by scheduling demos and sending quotes.

Appointment Scheduling: The company can schedule bookings for Buyers to visit the Property. They can use custom trigger features to keep track of upcoming appointments and to avoid double bookings. The Property details can also be sent as reminders to Buyers via email.


Service Requests: Buyers can log service requests for their Property issues, these would include online check-ins, location issues, etc. The company can use Salesforce’s case management feature to track service requests, assign them to the appropriate service team, and to provide status updates.

Service History: Salesforce can store a customer’s Property service history, such as when the Buyer was last serviced, what issues were done, and how long it took. This information can be used to recommend upcoming services and estimate times.

Analytics and Reporting: Salesforce can generate reports and dashboards to provide insights into key metrics such as lead sources, sales pipeline, appointment conversion rates, and service request volume. 
This data can be used to identify areas for improvement and optimize the dealership’s operations.

Overall, a Salesforce CRM project for a Property management company can help them to manage their customer interactions more efficiently and provide a better experience for their customers. It can streamline their sales and service processes, improve communication and collaboration among employees, and provide valuable insights into their business performance.


What are the possible integrations after this project is completed?
There are several integrations for a Salesforce CRM project that an Realtor Management dealership could include:

Email Integration: The dealership could integrate its email system with Salesforce to enable automatic email tracking and logging of email interactions with customers. This would help to ensure that all email communications with customers are captured in Salesforce, and can be viewed by sales representatives and service teams.

Telephone Integration: The dealership could integrate its telephone system with Salesforce to enable automatic call logging and tracking of telephone interactions with customers. This would help to ensure that all telephone communications with customers are captured in Salesforce, and can be viewed by sales representatives and service teams.

Social Media Integration: The dealership could integrate its social media accounts with Salesforce to capture leads and monitor customer interactions on social media platforms. This would help to ensure that all social media interactions with customers are captured in Salesforce, and can be viewed by sales representatives and service teams.

Marketing Automation Integration: The dealership could integrate its marketing automation system with Salesforce to enable lead nurturing and lead scoring. This would help to automate the lead follow-up process and ensure that leads are contacted at the right time with the right message.

Accounting Integration: The dealership could integrate its accounting software with Salesforce to ensure that sales and service transactions are automatically synced between systems. This would help to reduce errors and eliminate manual data entry.



Dealer Management System Integration: The dealership could integrate its dealer management system with Salesforce to ensure that all customer interactions and transactions are captured in one system. This would help to ensure that sales representatives and service teams have a complete view of the customer, and their history with the dealership.

eSignature Integration: An integration with an e-signature platform could enable managers to send and receive signed documents directly from Salesforce. This would help to speed up the contract and agreement process, and reduce the need for manual paper-based processes.

Overall, integrations can help to streamline operations, and improve efficiency by automating tasks and eliminating manual data entry. Integrating Salesforce with other systems can help to provide a seamless experience for customers and enable the dealership to provide better service.
